Research question: How do movies adapted from books differ from the book itself? 

Explanation of our research question: Nowadays lots of people prefer going to the movies instead of reading a book. However, a lot of movies are adaptations of literary works and other books. But how much of the original work can be seen in the film? Can the experience of a watcher compare to the experience of the reader? Results of the investigation can help shed light on how much of the original work is lost in a movie adaptation. One could get insight in whether a watcher of a movie is able to get the same experience from the movie as the author of the book intended for the reader.
